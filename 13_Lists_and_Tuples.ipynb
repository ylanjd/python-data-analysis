    "Often we need to store a number of single items of data together so that they can be processed together. This might be because all the data refers to one person (e.g. name, age, gender, etc) OR it might be because we have a set of data (e.g. all the items that should be displayed in a drop down list, such as all the years from this year back to 100 years ago so that someone can select their year of birth)\n",

    "Python has a range of data structures available including:\n",

    "This worksheet looks at lists and tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## List\n",
    "A list is a set of related, individual data objects, that are indexed and can be processed as a whole, as subsets or as individual items.  Lists are stored, essentially, as contiguous items in memory so that access can be as quick as possible.  However, they are mutable (they can be changed after they are created and stored) and so those mechanisms need to include extra functionality to deal with changing list sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tuple\n",
    "Essentially the same as a list but it is immutable.  Once it has been created it can't be changed.  It is stored in memory as contiguous items, with the size required being fixed right from the start.  This makes it faster to access.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below will create two lists and a tuple.\n",
    "*   the first list contains 1000 random numbers between 1 and 100\n",
    "*   the second list is of random length (up to 5000) and each item is one of the 9 characteristics that are protected under the Equality Act in the UK.\n",
    "*   the tuple contains the 9 protected characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start the exercises, run the code below.  It will generate the lists and tuple so that you can use them in the exercises.  If you need to recreate the lists again (because you have changed them and need to work on the originals, just run this cell again).\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note:***  *a list variable contains a reference to the start of the list in memory, rather than storing the list itself.  This means that if you assign the list to another variable (to make a copy), it will only copy across the reference.  If you change the copy, you change the original list.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you need to make a copy of the list you will need to use a loop to create a new list and copy all items across.*"
